 This is a rewriting of the linux-0.01 boot.s, using the 
 GNU assembler syntax with some modifications in the code.

 boot.s is loaded at 0x7c00 by the bios-startup routines, and moves itself
 out of the way to address 0x90000, and jumps there.

 It then loads the system at 0x10000, using BIOS interrupts. Thereafter
 it disables all interrupts, moves the system down to 0x0000, changes
 to protected mode, and calls the start of system. System then must
 RE-initialize the protected mode in it's own tables, and enable
 interrupts as needed.

- test the program

  1. make
  2. qemu-system-i386 boot
