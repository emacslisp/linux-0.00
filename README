 This is a rewriting of the linux-0.01 boot.s, using the 
 GNU assembler syntax with some modifications in the code.

 - boot.s

    boot.s is loaded at 0x7c00 by the bios-startup routines, and moves itself
    out of the way to address 0x90000, and jumps there.

    It then loads the system (kernel.s) at 0x10000, using BIOS interrupts. Thereafter
    it disables all interrupts, moves the system down to 0x0000, changes
    to protected mode, and calls the start of system. System then must
    RE-initialize the protected mode in it's own tables, and enable
    interrupts as needed.

 - main.c

    Is called from head.s to iitialize the system and switch to user mode.

 - kernel.c

    Will setup the stack and LDT and TSS descriptors in GDT.

 - booting the system

  1. make
  2. qemu-system-i386 boot
